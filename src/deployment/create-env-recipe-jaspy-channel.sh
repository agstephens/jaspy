# Script to create a version of the YAML environment file with 
# explicit URLs pointing to the JASPY channels on the CEDA server
#
# 1. Read the complete file
# 2. Modify URLs as follows:
#    - https://conda.anaconda.org/conda-forge/linux-64
#    - https://conda.anaconda.org/conda-forge/noarch
#    - https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/main
# 3. Put everything under: the JASPY channel URLs
