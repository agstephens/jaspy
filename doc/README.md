# Developing Help documentation for JASPY on JASMIN

We are trialling a new system for building and managing Python environments on JASMIN. There is a prototype Python 3.6 environment that you can try out which is mounted under `/apps/contrib/` across all the main LOTUS and `jasmin-sci*` servers. You can activate it with:

```
export PATH=/apps/contrib/jaspy/miniconda_envs/jaspy3.6/m3-4.5.4/bin:$PATH
source activate jaspy3.6-m3-4.5.4-r20180816
```

After that set-up your default python (for the current session) will be python 3.6.5.

Documentation on this approach, and the available environments, will appear in due course.
